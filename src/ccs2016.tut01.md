# Program Anomaly Detection: Methodology and Practices
###### [2016 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) Tutorial](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2016/tutorials/#anomaly)

## Task A: init

1. create your own directory (not conflict with others)

 `mkdir yourdir; cd yourdir`

2. get familiar with the modeling scripts ([usage example](https://github.com/subbyte/padlabs))

 `cp ~/padlabs/src/* ./`

## Task B: build an n-gram normal profile

1. strace

2. process the trace into a normal profile

## Task C: detect the Firefox exploit with n-gram model

1. [Firefox normal and exploit traces](https://github.com/subbyte/padlabs/tree/master/data/sample/firefox.syscall)

 `cp ~/padlabs/data/sample/firefox.syscall/* ./`

2. construct the n-gram model from profiles

3. perform detection on the exploited trace

## Task D: understand false positives in n-gram model

1. construct a Firefox n-gram model from 4 of the 5 normal profiles

2. perform deteciton on the 5th normal profile

3. try different n and understand the false positive issue of large n

4. discussion: threshold, probabilisic extension

## Task E (Demo): build and visualize a DFA model

1. generate vertices/edges

2. import into Neo4J for visualization

3. discussion: probabilistic extension
